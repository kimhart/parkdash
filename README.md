Welcome to ParkDash, an interactive dashboard of grab-and-go information about every National Park. This app helps users get a quick glimpse of any selected park â€” complete with trail maps (plus difficulty rating and mile length), weather forecast, safety advisories, trail closures, wildlife sightings, and camping ammenities. ParkDash also features a live feed of Instagram posts tagged at the park's location.
